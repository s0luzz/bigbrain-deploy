## layout consistency
- all pages use the same top navbar for logout and back navigation
- the layout is the same across login register dashboard edit and play screens

## visual hierarchy
- important actions are shown with big colored buttons
- headings are bigger and darker to show whats most important

## feedback and state indicators
- after submitting an answer players see a waiting screen
- when the answer is available the screen shows if you were correct
- admins see current session state like lobby or question 2

## responsive design
- layout changes with screen size using tailwind like sm grid cols
- padding and margin keep things spaced out on any device

## minimal friction
- lobby screen plays a looping video so players just wait
- dashboard uses simple buttons not complex steps

## accessibility of interaction
- hover effects and color changes show buttons are clickable
- button labels are simple and always describe what they do
